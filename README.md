## Description

The Social Network API is a backend application that serves as the foundation for a social networking web platform. It allows users to perform various actions, such as creating thoughts, reacting to thoughts, and managing their friends. This application is built using JavaScript, npm packages, Express.js for routing, MongoDB for data storage, and Mongoose for interacting with the MongoDB database. The API also provides endpoints for users and thoughts, enabling users to manage their data efficiently.
